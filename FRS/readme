Face Recognition Web Application
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is a Python-based Face Recognition Web App that allows users to:

Add new known faces to the system via a web interface.

Upload images for face detection and recognition.

Automatically label recognized faces and mark unknown ones.

View results with bounding boxes and names drawn on the image.

The app is fully interactive through a browser, providing a polished and user-friendly interface.

ðŸš€ Features
Face Detection & Recognition using deep learning.

Add New Faces Dynamically without restarting the app.

Clean Web UI for easy usage.

Image Processing and bounding box visualization.

Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3 â€“ Core programming language.

face_recognition â€“ Detects faces, extracts 128D facial embeddings, and compares them for recognition. Built on top of dlibâ€™s deep learning models.

OpenCV (cv2) â€“ Image processing: drawing rectangles, adding text, and saving results.

Flask â€“ Web framework for serving the app and handling uploads.

NumPy â€“ For numerical computations and similarity calculations.
